Kanji was throwing up and not her usual self on July 16th. She was back to her normal self on July 17th, but she cried if you touched her head in the wrong way. On July 18th, she developed a edema-like swelling on her head. This broke open in the late afternoon of the 18th. There was a pink exudate, that had an odour, but was not foul smelling.July 18th, 19:30pm\nJuly 18th, 10:30pm\n<img alt=\"2025-07-18 Sore on Head.jpeg\" src=\"2025-07-18-sore-on-head.jpeg\" target=\"_self\">July 18th, 10:30pm<br>\n<img alt=\"2025-07-18 Sore on Head (2).jpeg\" src=\"2025-07-18-sore-on-head-(2).jpeg\" target=\"_self\">The top of Kanji's head continued to scab over, and then it would fill with liquid. It would either break open on its own, or it would break when I bathed her head each morning and evening. I put on chlorhexidine from a swab.
